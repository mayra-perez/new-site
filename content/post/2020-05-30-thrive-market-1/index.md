## Abstract

Competition in the natural Mexican bottled sauce industry is growing. According to *Technavio Research*, the general market category is projected to increase by $66 billion through 2026 in North America (Beaton, 2022). As more companies emerge with the promise of tradition-inspired, clean products, the importance of differentiation becomes more pronounced. Using original sampling methods, this project will analyze online customer ratings (OCR) on condiments and sauces available at Thrive Market, an e-commerce retailer focused on natural and organic foods. Insights drawn from Thrive Market product features and customer analytics (the use of customer generated data to make business decisions) will inform a differentiation strategy for a new venture.

## Context

Established companies in the natural Mexican bottled sauce industry pose barriers to entry for new companies looking to enter the market with fewer resources and brand awareness. Established companies’ trusted company image may motivate existing customers to pay premium prices for products perceived as high quality. Similarly, strong supplier networks may support low-cost production and thus more desirable and accessible products. New companies looking to introduce a viable substitute in this contested space must demonstrate differentiation. When debuting in a crowded market, new entrants must strike the balance between a product that is novel yet comparable.

Understanding target consumers is critical for new companies looking to enter a competitive market space. According to software company *SAS*, customer generated data can deliver “valuable insights into consumer habits and lifestyle preferences” (Customer Analytics: What It Is and Why It Matters, 2022). Consumer ratings on similar products offered by competitors can provide intelligence on where companies are leading and where they are lacking. This is a unique opportunity to identify features, consumer values, and further inform the development a differentiation strategy in a saturated market.

## Proposal

Market research indicates consumers of natural food products are increasingly health- and planet-conscious. They purchase products that are clean, indulgent, and economical. For Millennial consumers, food is also an extension of experience and representation (Yue, 2019). Companies such as Frontera, Hatch Chili Company, and Siete Family Foods deliver on these values and do so at different price points. The central question for this project is – within the natural condiments and sauces industry – ***which features are predictive of customer satisfaction?*** Customer satisfaction here is defined as high customer ratings. Analysis of product features will provide additional insights on what distinguishes one company from another.

Using original sampling methods, I aim to compile a data set of over 300 products within the condiments and sauces category at Thrive Market. While product descriptions and customer ratings do not contain demographic information, these brands typically cater to health- and planet-conscious consumers. Therefore, insights can be used to learn more about this target consumer.

Depending on the state of the final data set, product descriptions and customer ratings will be analyzed to identify key themes, trends, and other important patterns. I expect to find substantive information that reveals consumer behavior and preferences beyond what is presented by prominent market research firms. Furthermore, my hope is to find quality insights that can be used to develop a differentiation strategy for a new venture.

## Conclusion

The growth of the natural Mexican foods industry is turning up the heat on established and emerging competitors. As new entrepreneurs enter the market with similar value propositions, the importance of differentiation becomes more pressing. This project aims to analyze product descriptions and customer ratings on over 300 condiments and sauces available at Thrive Market. The results will provide intelligence on where companies are leading and where they are lacking. Key themes, trends, and other important patterns will help inform a differentiation strategy in a saturated market.

If data quality proves successful, the sampling and analysis techniques used for this project may be applicable to future projects with similar objectives. If so, the project would be an excellent data science business case. The methods could potentially be documented and made them available to other graduate or early-career data scientists for replication.

However, the primary concern for this project is data quality. Most customer ratings may not be exclusive to products. They may be related to other factors, such as poor delivery or packaging (which may be more reflective of distribution issues and not the product). If data quality proves to be poor at the end of this project, lessons could potentially be documented for future consideration.
